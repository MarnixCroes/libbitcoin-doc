# Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Libbitcoin support Taproot?

No, Taproot is currently not supported.
This is on the roadmap.

### Does Libbitcoin support pruning?

No, Libbitcoin does not allow to prune the chain.

The two main reason are:

- If everyone would prune the chain, new nodes would not be able to bootstrap.
- Disk space is cheap and becoming cheaper every year. As the chain growth is lineair (fixed size) and hardware growth is exponential (Moore's law) disk space is even less of a worry each year.

### Does Libbitcoin have a GUI?

No, Libbitcoin does not have a Graphical User Interface.
However, Libbitcoin can build an Electrum index which can be used to connect a (GUI) wallet, like Electrum.
