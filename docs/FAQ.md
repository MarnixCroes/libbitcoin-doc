# Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Libbitcoin support Taproot?

No, Taproot is currently not supported.
This is on the roadmap.

### Does Libbitcoin support pruning?

No, Libbitcoin does not allow to prune the chain.

The two main reason are:

- If everyone would prune the chain, new nodes would not be able to bootstrap.
- Disk space is cheap and becoming cheaper every year. As the chain growth is lineair (fixed size) and hardware growth is exponential (Moore's law) disk space is even less of a worry each year.

### Is it possible to mine using Libbitcoin?

Libbitcoin does not currently have a mining interface, although anyone is free to build on top of/using Libbitcoin.

Implementing a mining interface is a future plan.
